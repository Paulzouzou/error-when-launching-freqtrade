# error-when-launching-freqtrade
Hello, I just started in freqtrade, I installed it with docker. I don't understand why I get this error ( Config file "/freqtrade/user_data/config.json" not found! Please create a config file or check whether it exists) when I type in the terminal docker-compose logs -f.
